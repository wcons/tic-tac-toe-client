# Tic Tac Toe Game

##Technologies Used:
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript
 - jQuery
 - Bootstrap
 - Sass

##Background

For planning and development, I decided to start building the HTML and working
with the authentication API first, because I was more comfortable with the API
and knew I would be able to build this out so that I would have some part of the
 app that worked right away.  Making the logic of the game work and then
 expressing that in JavaScript seemed like it was going to be the most difficult
part of the project.  I tried to break it down into smaller problems - the board
 has 9 fields, and each can have one of three values (empty, x, or o).  One of
 the first problems I solved was how to determine which token should go into a
 slot - this was a small part of the problem that I could make work right away.
Then I tested to make sure it fulfilled the requirements.  This was my approach
to the whole project - I tried to break larger problems into simpler ones that
were easier to tackle.

##Improvements:
  *- API: Save game after each move - saving cells field is not working*
  *- API: Display user's streak of games won*
  - Don't use buttons for gameboard
  - Style Improvements
  - Load a saved in-progress game and determine whose turn it was
  - Two-player games
